This project focuses on optimizing asset allocation in an investment portfolio for a firm managing client portfolios. The goal is to develop a program that determines the optimal distribution of assets to maximize expected return while keeping risk within a specified tolerance level.

Two approaches are implemented and compared:

Brute Force: Exhaustively evaluates all possible allocations.
Dynamic Programming: Efficiently computes the optimal allocation by breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems.
